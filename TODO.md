- logs are malformed in zeebe (argument list)
- ffmpeg service does not handle multiple input files
- watchfolder service
- Parse ffmpeg errors
- implement virtualfs fallback for non sequential reads/writes by caching the file locally on a diskfs
- clean todos
- minio: create buckets when they do not exist on write
- sanitize service inputs
- add another db for storing detailed logs (influx maybe?)
